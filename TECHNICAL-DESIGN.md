# Career Profile & Targeted CV Generator — Agent Design

## 1. Goal

Two-stage pipeline:

1. **Ingest** LinkedIn, GitHub, CV (docx/PDF), and free text → produce a single canonical **Personal Career Summary** (structured JSON + narrative).
2. **Target** — given a job post, use that summary to generate a **tailored CV** (and optionally a cover letter) that emphasizes relevant experience without fabricating anything.

This maps cleanly onto your existing Orchestrator/Analytic/Coding-style agent pattern — same LangGraph graph-of-agents shape, different domain.

```

Each box is a node in a LangGraph `StateGraph`, same as your Backtesting/Discovery agents — this keeps it consistent with FUND's existing conventions (per-agent `SKILL.md`, shared Pydantic state, `interrupt()` for human review before final CV output).

---

## 3. Stage 1 — Ingestion Agents (per source)

Each source gets its own thin ingestion node that normalizes raw input into text/JSON before the LLM ever sees it. Keep parsing deterministic (no LLM) where possible — cheaper and more reliable.

| Source | Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **LinkedIn** | User-provided **data export** (Settings → "Get a copy of your data") or manual paste of profile text | LinkedIn's ToS blocks scraping and there's no public profile-read API for personal apps — don't build a scraper. The official export gives you Positions, Education, Skills, Certifications, Recommendations as CSV/JSON. Implemented in Phase 2 (`src/tools/linkedin_export.py`) — see below. |
| **GitHub** | GitHub REST/GraphQL API (`api.github.com`) — repos, README content, languages, commit stats, pinned repos | You already have `api.github.com` in your allowed domains. Pull repo descriptions + top languages + README excerpts, not full source — keep token cost down. Coverage spans owned, organization, and contributed-to repos — see below. |
| **CV (docx)** | `python-docx` / your docx skill's read path | Extract text preserving section structure (headers as section boundaries). |
| **CV (PDF)** | `pdfplumber` or the pdf-reading skill | Watch for two-column CVs — plain text extraction can interleave columns; consider layout-aware extraction or page rasterization + vision fallback for complex layouts. |
| **Free text / paste** | Passthrough | e.g. person pastes bio or notes directly. |

Output of this stage: a list of `SourceDocument { source_type, raw_text, structured_fields? }`.

### GitHub source coverage & the attribution contract (Phase 1.f, 2026-07-21)

`/users/{u}/repos?type=owner` returns *only* repos under the personal username,
so work done inside organizations and contributions to other people's repos —
for many engineers the majority of their real output — were invisible. The
client (`src/tools/github_client.py`) now collects three tiers:

| Tier | Source | Detail fetched |
|---|---|---|
| **Owned** | the repo listing below, partitioned by `owner.login == u` | description, primary language, stars, `languages`, README excerpt |
| **Organization / collaborator** | the same listing's non-owned rows that pass the contribution probe, attributed to their owner; the org listing distinguishes *member of* from *collaborator on* | same as owned |
| **External contributions** | with `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GraphQL `user.repositoriesContributedTo(includeUserRepositories:false)` + `contributionsCollection.commitContributionsByRepository` (⚠️ defaults to the **last 12 months** — looped per year); without: REST `GET /search/issues?q=author:{u}+type:pr+is:merged`, aggregated per repo | contribution scope ("6 merged PRs; 41 commits") + PR titles, and **no README excerpt** |

Forks stay excluded — a fork is not evidence; the merged PR it produced is.
`GET /search/commits` is rejected: it counts forks and mirrors (57,068 "commits"
for a user with 778 real commit contributions).

**Attribution contract (anti-fabrication).** Rendering `pallets/flask` under the
same bare `## Repository:` heading as the user's own project invites synthesis
to credit them with the whole framework. So the source document is structured
into explicitly labelled sections — `## Owned repositories`,
`## Organization repositories (member of|collaborator on <org>)`, and
`## Contributions to external repositories (not owned by the user)` — external
entries are marked `(owned by others)` and carry only the contribution
evidence, and `skills/source-extraction/SKILL.md` gains an "Ownership vs.
contribution" rule: a contribution to a repo the user does not own is evidence
of *that contribution*, never of authorship or ownership of the project. README
excerpts are quoted line-by-line (`> `) because READMEs carry their own `##`
headings, which would otherwise read as section boundaries of this document and
blur the very labelling the contract depends on.

**Budget & degradation.** READMEs/languages are fetched only for owned and org
repos; external repos are ranked by contribution volume (not `updated`) and
capped by `GITHUB_MAX_EXTERNAL_REPOS`; the merged-PR search is paged once. A
403/429 on search logs a `WARNING` and degrades to owned + org repos rather than
failing the ingest, and `GITHUB_INCLUDE_CONTRIBUTIONS=false` skips the extra
calls entirely.

### Membership privacy & the contribution probe (Phase 1.g, 2026-07-21)

Phase 1.f was verified against public API responses, which hid two facts that
made its organization tier both incomplete and noisy.

**Private membership is the default.** `GET /users/{u}/orgs` returns *public*
memberships only. For the reference account it returned `[]` while the user
belonged to five organizations — so tier 2 could only ever surface the handful of
public org repos that happened to appear in the public repo listing, and the
document silently understated the user's entire employment history. Worse, the
14 repos Phase 1.f proudly labelled "external contributions **not owned by the
user**" were mostly repos of the user's *own companies*: unable to see the
affiliation, the client had inverted the attribution and undersold them.

The fix is a **self-token** path. `GET /user` resolves the token's identity on
every run; when it matches the ingested username the client switches to the
viewer endpoints, which see private memberships and private repos:

| | Third-party / no token | Self-token |
|---|---|---|
| Orgs | `GET /users/{u}/orgs` (public only) | `GET /user/orgs` |
| Repos | `GET /users/{u}/repos?type=all` | `GET /user/repos?affiliation=owner,organization_member,collaborator` (paged) |

The identity check is what makes this safe: a token issued to anyone other than
the ingested username never reaches a viewer endpoint, so it cannot surface a
third party's private data. `GITHUB_INCLUDE_PRIVATE=false` keeps private repos
out of the document while still discovering the memberships, and private repos
that are included are rendered with a `Visibility: private` line so tailoring
never offers one as a public portfolio link.

**Access is not contribution.** The same listing exposes the opposite failure:
`affiliation=collaborator` returns every repo the user was ever invited to. For
the reference account that was 88 repos, of which the user had committed to
exactly **one**. Rendering them all would hand the extractor 87 other people's
projects to write achievements from — a fabrication risk larger than the one the
labelled sections were built to solve. Every non-owned repo therefore has to
prove itself:

- repos already proven by the merged-PR search or the GraphQL commit counts pass
  for free;
- the rest cost one `GET /repos/{full}/commits?author={u}` probe each, bounded by
  `GITHUB_MAX_CONTRIBUTION_PROBES`; anything unproven is dropped, never assumed.

The GraphQL commit map was evaluated as the sole filter and rejected: it found 8
of the 26 repos the user had really committed to, because
`contributionsCollection` counts only default-branch commits under a matching
account email. The REST probe found all 26.

Survivors are capped by `GITHUB_MAX_ORG_REPOS`, most recent contribution first,
but **each organization keeps at least one repo before recency fills the rest** —
a straight recency sort dropped two 2021-era employers entirely, and a resume
needs the breadth of employers more than a fifth repo from the current one.

### Batched per-repo GitHub extraction (Phase 5.c, 2026-07-22)

The two-tier resilience of Phase 1.e has a hole exactly where GitHub sits. One
`github_username` renders **one** `SourceDocument` holding every repo, so the
item-level salvage in `extract_one` only helps when the model returns a *parseable
but invalid* tool call. When it returns a message with **no tool call at all** —
which ~49k chars of input asking for ~50 repos of structured output made likely —
there is nothing to salvage from, and the source-level net in `extract_source`
can only drop the whole document. A real run lost 50 repos that way, and still
returned 200 with a success banner.

The fix is to stop asking for all of it at once:

1. **Split.** `github_client.split_repo_sections` cuts a rendered document into
   one `RepoChunk` per `### Repository:` section, and `render_repo_document`
   reassembles any subset. The spans tile the document exactly, so
   `render(split(text)) == text` — re-rendering an untouched document is a no-op,
   which is what makes the pruning below safe to trust. Both live in
   `github_client.py`, beside the rendering they invert, so the format is
   described in exactly one file.
2. **Every chunk carries its tier heading.** `skills/source-extraction/SKILL.md`
   decides ownership-vs-contribution attribution from the `## Owned repositories`
   / `## Organization repositories (…)` / `## Contributions to external
   repositories (not owned by the user)` labelling. A chunk extracted without its
   heading would be read as authorship — the batching would otherwise have
   re-opened the exact fabrication risk Phase 1.f closed.
3. **Batch, then isolate.** `_extract_github` sends
   `GITHUB_REPOS_PER_EXTRACTION` repos per call. A failed batch is retried **one
   repo at a time**, so the blame lands on a specific repository instead of on
   its forty-nine neighbours. Per-batch extractions merge by concatenating the
   list fields; `name`/`headline`/`contact` take the first non-empty value.
   Duplicates across batches are left to synthesis, which already dedupes.
   Raising only when *every* repo fails preserves the Phase 1.e rule that a
   silently empty profile is worse than an error.

**Synthesis is deliberately out of scope.** It still funnels every project
through one LLM call that must re-emit them all — the same output-size fragility
one stage later. It is left alone until extraction is demonstrably reliable,
rather than fixed speculatively.

**The archive splits in two.** `data/sources/{run_id}/github/github.json` is
rewritten after extraction to hold only the repos that reached the profile, and
the as-fetched document is preserved beside it as `github.raw.json` with its own
manifest entry (`{source_id}#as-fetched`). Pruning the archive without keeping
the original would destroy the evidence needed to investigate the drop. The
rewrite happens in `store_profile`, the node that already owns run-store I/O, fed
by the new `IngestionState.pruned_sources`; `extract_source` stays a pure LLM
step. Nothing is written when nothing was dropped.

**Partial success is never silent.** `IngestionState.source_errors`
(`{"source", "repo", "reason"}`) propagates to the `/ingest` response and streams
as `warning` SSE events, and the UI lists the skipped repos and qualifies its
success banner. That a run could lose a whole source and still render as a clean
success is what made this bug expensive to find, so the reporting is part of the
fix rather than a nicety. Correspondingly, a response with no tool call now logs
`finish_reason`, usage and a content preview — the old code logged the empty
`parsing_error` as literally `: None`.

### Per-request GitHub token (Phase 5.a, 2026-07-21)

Phases 1.f/1.g read the token from the module-global `config.GITHUB_TOKEN`,
bound once at import. One process therefore served exactly one credential, and —
because the self-token identity check derives from that same global — exactly
one user could ever have their private repos read. Ingesting a second username
with *their* token meant editing `.env` and restarting.

The token is now a parameter, threaded from `fetch_github_profile(username,
client=None, token=None)` down through `_headers`, `_viewer_login`, `_graphql`
and `_gather_evidence`, and resolved as `token or config.GITHUB_TOKEN` at the
top of the fetch. `POST /ingest` exposes it as a `github_token` form field
(blank → `None` → the configured fallback), so env-only deployments behave
exactly as before.

What this does **not** change is the safety property from 1.g: the
`GET /user` identity check simply runs per request instead of per process, so
user B's token unlocks B's private repos while a token belonging to neither
party still never reaches a viewer endpoint. What it adds is a handling
obligation — the token is a secret in transit, so it is deliberately absent from
`manifest.json`, from the archived `github.json`, and from every log line (the
existing `github[%s]: token viewer=%s` DEBUG line logs the *resolved login*,
which is exactly the non-secret part worth having). It is held nowhere after the
request: not in `data/`, and in the UI not in `localStorage` either.

### Same-named uploads stay distinct (Phase 5.b, 2026-07-21)

`run_store.save_source_file` wrote to `sources/{run_id}/{category}/{filename}`,
so two uploads named `CV.docx` overwrote each other. The quieter half of the bug
was in `routes._load_upload`, which derived `doc.id = f"{source_type}:{filename}"`
from the *uploaded* name: the two sources also collided as source ids, and
`CareerProfile.raw_source_map` — the map the anti-fabrication gate reads to trace
a claim back to its document — lost the ability to tell them apart.

`save_source_file` now suffixes a taken name (`CV.docx` → `CV-2.docx` → …) and
returns the path it actually wrote, and both `_load_upload` and
`_load_linkedin_export` build `doc.id` from `stored.name`. Deriving the id from
the storage layer's answer rather than the request's is what keeps the two in
step: the archive and the traceability map can no longer disagree about how many
sources there were.

### LinkedIn data-export ingestion (Phase 2, 2026-07-21)

`src/tools/linkedin_export.py` parses the archive the person downloads from
LinkedIn themselves (or individual CSVs from it). Deterministic, offline, and
**no scraping** — there is no network call in this module at all, which is the
design constraint above expressed as code.

One upload → one `SourceDocument` (`source_type="linkedin"`,
`id="linkedin:<filename>"`) carrying both representations of the same data:

| Field | Contents | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `structured_fields` | Exported rows verbatim, grouped into `profile`, `positions`, `education`, `skills`, `certifications`, `recommendations_received` | The extraction prompt, as **authoritative records** |
| `raw_text` | Deterministic Markdown rendering of the same sections | The extraction prompt as readable context; also what a human sees in the archive |

Both are sent. The records are what the model must follow; the rendering keeps
a LinkedIn source shaped like every other source in the pipeline (and readable
in `data/sources/{run_id}/`). The duplication costs tokens on a large export
and is accepted for that reason.

Two properties of the real export drive the parser:

- **File names drift between export versions** (`Recommendations_Received.csv`
  vs `Recommendations Received.csv`), so a section is matched on a *normalized*
  stem (lowercased, non-alphanumerics collapsed), not an exact filename.
  Unrecognized members (ads, messages, connections) are skipped with a DEBUG
  log rather than guessed at.
- **Several CSVs open with a free-text `Notes:` preamble** before the header
  row, so the header is located by its columns (`Company Name`/`Title` for
  positions, etc.) instead of being assumed to be line 1. Blank cells are
  dropped rather than stored as `""`, so an absent field stays absent — the
  same contract §4's nullable-field rules enforce downstream.

An export with no recognizable section raises `ValueError` → HTTP 400, rather
than ingesting an empty source. The upload is archived *before* parsing (as CVs
are), so even a rejected export is on disk to inspect.

**Attribution.** Two exported record types are not the person's own claims and
are labelled as such in the rendering and in `skills/source-extraction/SKILL.md`:
profile **skills** are self-asserted (a skill, never an achievement), and
**recommendations** are written by other people (rendered under
"Recommendations received (written by other people)" with the author named).
This is the same anti-fabrication discipline the GitHub tier labelling above
exists to enforce.

---

## 4. Stage 2 — Extraction Agent (LLM)

One LLM call per source (or batched), converting messy raw text into a **common schema**. This is the "normalize" step — same idea as your Analytic Agent turning unstructured strategy docs into structured summaries.

```python
class Experience(BaseModel):
    company: str
    title: str
    start_date: str | None
    end_date: str | None
    location: str | None
    bullets: list[str]          # verbatim-ish achievements, not embellished
    source: str                 # "linkedin" | "cv" | "github"

class Project(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    technologies: list[str]
    role: str | None
    url: str | None
    source: str

class Skill(BaseModel):
    name: str
    category: str                # "language" | "framework" | "domain" | "tool"
    evidence_count: int          # how many sources/repos/roles support this

class CareerProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    headline: str | None
    contact: dict
    experiences: list[Experience]
    projects: list[Project]
    education: list[dict]
    skills: list[Skill]
    certifications: list[str]
    summary_narrative: str        # 2-3 paragraph human-readable synthesis
    raw_source_map: dict[str, str]  # traceability: claim -> source doc
```

Key design choice: **every field keeps a `source` pointer.** This is what makes stage 3's anti-fabrication check possible — you can always trace a bullet back to a real document.

### Structured-source prompt variant (Phase 2, 2026-07-21)

Most sources are prose (a CV, a README, pasted notes) and the model has to read
them. A LinkedIn data export is not: it is rows the person exported. So
`extraction_prompt` gained a `{structured}` slot, filled by
`extraction._structured_block` only when `SourceDocument.structured_fields` is
present, that hands the model the records as JSON and states they are
authoritative over the rendered text below them. Prose sources get an empty
block, so their prompt is byte-for-byte what it was before — one prompt module,
one node, no LinkedIn-specific branch in the graph.

### Nullable-field contract (Phase 1.e, 2026-07-21)

The anti-fabrication skill instructs the model to *leave an absent field empty
rather than invent a value*, so `null` is a **correct** extractor output, not an
error. The schema is therefore what yields: extraction-facing fields carry a
`mode="before"` validator (`NullableStr` → `""`, `NullableList` → `[]`, in
`src/models/schemas.py`) so a `null` coerces instead of rejecting the whole
payload.

| Model | Null-tolerant fields |
|---|---|
| `Experience` | `company`, `title`, `source`, `bullets` |
| `Project` | `name`, `description` (also defaults to `""`), `source`, `technologies` |
| `Skill` | `name`, `category` |
| `JobRequirements` | `required_skills`, `preferred_skills`, `responsibilities`, `keywords_for_ats` |

Models that are **not** LLM-extraction targets — `TailoredCV`, `ValidationFlag`,
`ValidationResult`, `CoverLetter` — stay strict: a `null` there is a real bug and
must still raise. `SKILL.md` is deliberately unchanged.

Ripple: `synthesis.build_raw_source_map` skips falsy claims, because once
descriptions can be `""` every description-less project would otherwise collide
on a single `""` key in the map the validation gate reads.

### Two-tier extraction resilience (Phase 1.e)

One `github_username` yields exactly **one** `SourceDocument` holding all repos,
so resilience at the source level cannot save individual repos. Two tiers:

1. **Item-level salvage** (`extract_one`, the primary net). The strict
   `SourceExtraction` remains the tool schema handed to the model — it is what
   steers the output — but the call uses `with_structured_output(...,
   include_raw=True)`, which *surfaces* a `ValidationError` in
   `{"parsed", "raw", "parsing_error"}` instead of raising. On the failure path
   the extraction is rebuilt from `raw.tool_calls[0]["args"]` field by field,
   validating `experiences`/`projects`/`skills` **one element at a time** and
   dropping only the failures (logged at WARNING with list index, `name`, and
   the pydantic message). If salvage recovers nothing usable — no tool call,
   unparseable args, or every item rejected — the original error is **re-raised**:
   a silently empty profile is worse than a 500.
2. **Source-level net** (`extract_source`, coarse last resort). A hard failure
   on one source (provider error, no parseable response at all) is logged and
   skipped so the surviving sources still produce a profile; if *every* source
   fails, the error is raised. This does not save individual repos — losing a
   source here still loses that whole document.

With the nullable-field contract in place tier 1 should rarely fire; it is
defense-in-depth for the next malformed field, not the primary remedy.

**Superseded for GitHub by Phase 5.c** (§3, "Batched per-repo GitHub
extraction"): both tiers assume the model returned *something* parseable, so
neither survives a response with no tool call at all. GitHub sources are now
split into per-repo batches before either tier applies; the two tiers above still
govern every other source type, and still apply within each batch.

---

## 5. Stage 3 — Synthesis Agent (LLM)

Merges the per-source extractions into one `CareerProfile`:
- De-duplicates overlapping entries (same job listed in CV and LinkedIn).
- Resolves date/title conflicts by preferring the most detailed source, and flags conflicts back to the user rather than silently picking one.
- Writes `summary_narrative` — this is the reusable "elevator pitch" used later for tailoring.
- Infers `Skill.evidence_count` from cross-referencing GitHub language stats + CV mentions + LinkedIn skills list.

This `CareerProfile` JSON is your durable artifact — store it (Postgres/JSON file), it's what stage 2 (job targeting) consumes repeatedly without re-ingesting sources each time.

---

## 6. Stage 4 — Job Analysis Agent

Given a job post (pasted text or URL):
- Extracts: required skills, nice-to-haves, seniority level, key responsibilities, company/domain context.
- Produces a `JobRequirements` schema, same idea as `CareerProfile`.

```python
class JobRequirements(BaseModel):
    title: str
    company: str | None
    required_skills: list[str]
    preferred_skills: list[str]
    responsibilities: list[str]

## 7. Stage 5 — CV Tailoring Agent

This is the core generation step. Prompt structure (not code, but the shape that matters):

- **Input:** `CareerProfile` (full) + `JobRequirements`.
- **Instruction constraints** (critical, put these as hard rules in the system prompt):
  1. Only use facts present in `CareerProfile` — no new employers, dates, titles, or skills.
  2. Re-order and re-weight existing bullets toward job-relevant ones; don't invent new bullets.
  3. Rephrase bullets to mirror the job post's terminology *only when the underlying fact supports it* (e.g. if profile says "built distributed trading backtester" and job wants "distributed systems experience," it's fair to foreground that phrase — but don't claim technologies not evidenced).
  4. Select a subset of `experiences`/`projects` — not everything, prioritized by relevance score.
  5. Output structured JSON matching a `TailoredCV` schema, not raw prose — so the Document Agent can render it deterministically.

```python
class TailoredCV(BaseModel):
    headline: str
    summary: str                 # 2-4 sentences, job-specific framing
    selected_experiences: list[Experience]   # subset + reordered/reworded bullets
    selected_projects: list[Project]
    highlighted_skills: list[str]
    relevance_notes: dict[str, str]  # internal: why each item was chosen (for validation/debugging, not shown on CV)
```

---

## 8. Stage 6 — Validation Agent (anti-hallucination gate)

This is the piece worth not skipping. A second, separate LLM call (or even non-LLM diffing) that:
- Checks every bullet/skill in `TailoredCV` against `CareerProfile.raw_source_map`.
- Flags anything with no traceable source as `needs_review`.
- Optionally runs a simple string/embedding similarity check between generated bullets and original bullets to catch drift.

If using LangGraph, this is a natural `interrupt()` point — surface flagged items to the user for approval before rendering, consistent with the human-in-the-loop pattern you used in your earlier LangChain agent work.

**Implemented in Phase 4** — `human_review` sits between `validate_cv` and
rendering and calls `interrupt()`, so the run pauses with its state
checkpointed instead of handing the decision back to the client. See
"Human-in-the-loop review" under §13.

---

## 9. Stage 7 — Document Agent

Renders `TailoredCV` → `.docx` (and/or PDF) using a template. This is a pure rendering step, no LLM — use `python-docx` with a template + style, or Claude's own docx skill if this is running inside Claude Code/Claude.ai rather than as a standalone service.

### Rendering & the render gate (Phase 3, 2026-07-21)

Implemented as two pieces, deliberately split so the decision and the drawing
are separately testable:

- **`src/tools/docx_renderer.py` — pure layout.** Everything it writes already
  exists in the `TailoredCV` / `CoverLetter` that the validation gate checked,
  so the renderer never adds, rewrites, or infers content; it only lays it out.
  Section order is fixed and mirrors the schema (name/contact header → headline
  → summary → experiences → projects → skills). `relevance_notes` is internal
  tailoring reasoning and is **not** rendered; empty sections are omitted
  entirely rather than emitted as empty headings.
- **`src/agents/document.py` — the gate.** `skip_reason()` answers *whether*
  rendering may happen; `render_documents()` drives the renderer. A CV whose
  claims validation could not trace back to the profile must not quietly become
  a polished file someone sends out, so a run with `needs_review` flags renders
  **nothing** unless the caller passes `approve_flagged` (Phase 3's review is
  client-side — the caller has already seen `validation.flags` in the response;
  Phase 4 replaces this with a graph `interrupt()`).

**Templates.** `DOCX_TEMPLATE` optionally points at a base `.docx` supplying
styles/theme/letterhead; content is always *appended* by the renderer, so no
placeholder-substitution engine is needed. A template lacking the built-in
`Heading 1` / `List Bullet` styles degrades to bold/plain paragraphs instead of
raising, and a configured-but-missing template falls back to python-docx's
default with a WARNING.

**PDF.** A second, separable step: the rendered `.docx` is converted by headless
LibreOffice (`LIBREOFFICE_BIN`, shipped in the Docker image as
`libreoffice-writer`), invoked with a throwaway `-env:UserInstallation` profile
because `HOME` is not reliably writable in a container. A missing binary, a
non-zero exit, or a timeout logs a WARNING and yields `None` — the `.docx` is
the guaranteed output and a PDF is never allowed to fail a tailoring run.
`RENDER_PDF=false` skips the attempt outright.

### Cover letter (design doc §1's optional second output)

`tailoring.generate_cover_letter` is an LLM node (`COVER_LETTER_MODEL`,
defaulting to `TAILORING_MODEL`) producing the `CoverLetter` schema. It is given
the profile, the `JobRequirements` **and** the already-tailored CV: that CV is
the set of facts deemed relevant to this posting, so the letter *connects* them
rather than re-selecting from scratch. It composes the `cover-letter` skill with
`anti-fabrication` (same pattern as tailoring), so the letter is bound by the
same no-invention rules as the CV — plus two rules the letter form makes
necessary: no inventing motivations or claims about the company, and no
restating third-party recommendations as the candidate's own claims.

---

## 10. Tech stack (matches your FUND stack)

- **Orchestration:** LangGraph `StateGraph`, one node per agent above, shared Pydantic state object.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, endpoints like `/ingest`, `/profile/{id}`, `/tailor` (job post in → CV out), SSE for streaming progress on long ingestion jobs — same pattern as your ATA's 17 REST/SSE endpoints.
- **Storage:** `CareerProfile` JSON per user in Postgres (or even just versioned JSON files if single-user) so re-tailoring for new job posts doesn't re-run ingestion.
- **Models:** Haiku for extraction (cheap, high-volume, per-source), Sonnet for synthesis + tailoring (needs judgment), optionally Opus for the validation/anti-hallucination pass since precision matters most there — the same tiering strategy you're already using for subagent cost control.
- **Frontend:** could reuse your React/Vite/TanStack scaffold — a simple 3-panel UI: sources → profile review/edit → job post + generated CV diff view.

### Frontend as built (Phase 4, 2026-07-21)

React 19 + Vite + TanStack Query in `frontend/`, TypeScript throughout, exactly
the three panels above (`frontend/src/panels/`):

| Panel | Reads/writes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SourcesPanel` | `POST /ingest`, `GET /ingest/{job_id}/events` | Subscribes to the SSE stream *before* POSTing, so no node event is missed. Generates its own `job_id` for that reason. File inputs **accumulate** across picks (Phase 5.b) |
| `ProfilePanel` | `GET`/`PUT /profile/{id}` | Edits a local draft (a slow save never fights the typing); each conflict's chosen value is recorded in the new `Conflict.resolution` field. Draws every stored section — contact, experience, projects, education, skills, certifications (Phase 6.d) |
| `TailorPanel` | `POST /tailor`, `GET /document/{id}` | Side-by-side profile-vs-tailored bullet table, plus the selected projects in the order the `.docx` renders them; hands a paused run to `ReviewPanel` |
| `ReviewPanel` | `POST /tailor/{id}/resume` | Per-item Keep/Remove, defaulting to Remove — the same default as the server |

Two decisions worth recording:

- **The UI ships inside the API image.** A multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds the
  bundle in a `node:20-slim` stage and copies `dist/` into the Python runtime,
  which mounts it at `/` (`FRONTEND_DIR`). One container, one origin, no CORS,
  and no Node in the shipped image. Without a build, `/` still redirects to
  `/docs`, so a backend-only checkout is unaffected.
- **The dev server's address is configuration, not code.** Because production
  has no Vite server at all, the only place a host/port matters is development —
  so `vite.config.ts` reads `UI_HOST`/`UI_PORT` (bind address) separately from
  `API_URL` (proxy target), defaulting to loopback:5173 so nothing is exposed by
  accident, with `strictPort` on so a busy port fails instead of quietly moving.
  These live in the shell, not `.env`: the backend never reads them.
- **A file input reports only the current pick (Phase 5.b).** `SourcesPanel`
  originally did `setCvFiles(Array.from(event.target.files))` on every `change`,
  which reads as "these are the files" but means "these are the files chosen in
  *this* dialog" — a second pick dropped the first. It now merges into the
  staged list, keyed on `name+size+lastModified`, renders the staged files with
  per-file remove buttons, and clears `event.target.value` after reading so
  re-picking a removed file fires `change` again. The pick must be read into a
  local *before* that clear, since the state updater runs afterwards.
- **The GitHub token field is component state only** — `type="password"`, never
  `localStorage`, and appended to the `FormData` only when non-empty.
- **The diff similarity is display-only.** `frontend/src/lib/diff.ts` scores
  bullets with a bigram Dice coefficient purely to label them
  unchanged/reworded/new. The authoritative judgement stays server-side
  (difflib + LLM cross-check); anything the gate flagged renders as flagged
  whatever the client scores.
- **The screen draws everything the profile stores (Phase 6.d).** `ProfilePanel`
  originally rendered only name, headline, summary, conflicts, experience and
  skills, so a GitHub-only ingest — 56 repos in `projects` — looked like it had
  produced nothing, which is the exact indistinguishability Phase 5.c set out to
  remove. `projects`, `education`, `certifications` and `contact` now have
  markup, and `TailorPanel` draws `selected_projects` between the bullets and
  the skills, matching `docx_renderer.render_cv`'s section order so the review
  screen and the approved document agree. Two constraints shaped it:
  `education` is `list[dict]` with **no** guaranteed keys, so entries render
  familiar keys first and list whatever else they carry rather than dropping it;
  and a 56-item list would bury the Save button, so long lists show ten with a
  "Show all *n*" toggle. `diff.ts` gained `diffProjects`, which matches by
  lower-cased name — the same key `validation.py` and `review.py` use, so a
  project the UI marks flagged is the one the gate flagged, never a near-miss
  of the client's own invention.
- **Panel state lifecycle is expressed as remounts (Phases 6.a/6.b).** Only one
  piece of state is shared — the active `profile_id` in `App.tsx`. Everything
  else (staged files, the GitHub token, the edited draft, the tailored result
  and its download links) is component-local and unreachable from the parent, so
  "start over" is not a prop threaded through four components and a dozen
  `useState`s that would drift as the panels gain fields. Instead:
  - `<SourcesPanel key={"sources-" + sessionKey}>` — a `sessionKey` counter
    bumped by **Clear everything**, which also calls
    `useQueryClient().clear()` (without it the remounted `ProfilePanel`
    redraws the previous profile instantly from cache) and is guarded by a
    `window.confirm`, since unsaved edits and a typed token go with it.
  - `<ProfilePanel>` / `<TailorPanel>` are keyed on **`sessionKey` + the active
    profile id**, so a new profile remounts both. That closes two windows at
    once: `ProfilePanel` used to keep rendering the *old* profile's headline
    under the *new* id between the id changing and the fetch landing (its
    `draft` updates only when data arrives), and `TailorPanel.result` was never
    reset at all — its diff, its pending review and its download links (which
    carry the old `tailor_id`) survived the change of profile. Sibling keys are
    prefixed because two children of one parent may not share a key.
  - **Inputs clear on success, never on click.** `SourcesPanel` empties the
    staged files, free text, token and target-profile id in the mutation's
    `onSuccess`, so a second "Build profile" cannot silently re-ingest the same
    CVs — but a *failed* run keeps everything staged, because re-picking every
    file is the wrong price for a 500. The progress list and the outcome banner
    (including the skipped repos) survive the clear: they describe the run that
    just finished, not the next one.
- **A failed refresh is not a failed load (Phase 6.c).** `ProfilePanel` tested
  `query.isError` *before* `draft`, so any failure — including a background
  refetch that React Query keeps the previous `data` through — replaced a
  profile that was already loaded and possibly edited. A one-second network
  blip cost the user their work. The fatal branch is now `isError && !draft`
  (a first-load failure must still be caught before the loading branch, or the
  panel spins for ever); with a draft in hand the failure renders as a
  `role="alert"` banner above the still-editable profile, with a Retry button
  calling `query.refetch()`. `TailorPanel` gets the same treatment where it
  matters more quietly: with no profile to diff against it used to draw an
  empty comparison table, which reads as "nothing changed" rather than "the
  comparison is missing" — a dangerous thing to believe about a CV about to be
  approved. Its banner is conditioned on `!profileQuery.data`, since a failed
  refetch still leaves the last copy to diff against.
- **The query defaults now say what the comment claimed (Phase 6.c).**
  `staleTime: 0` marked every response stale on arrival, so each new observer
  of `["profile", id]` refetched — and there are two, `ProfilePanel` and
  `TailorPanel` — while `refetchOnReconnect` (on by default) refired on any
  online/offline flicker and `retry: false` turned the first blip straight into
  an error state. `main.tsx` now sets `staleTime: 30_000`,
  `refetchOnReconnect: false` and `retry: 1`; freshness comes from the save
  path's explicit `invalidateQueries`, which ignores `staleTime`.
- **Transport failure and HTTP failure are now distinguishable (Phase 6.c).**
  `fetch` rejects with a bare `TypeError: Failed to fetch` on a connection
  reset, DNS failure, proxy hang-up or offline browser, which reads as a bug in
  the client; an HTTP error is a resolved response with `ok === false`, carrying
  FastAPI's `detail`. `lib/api.ts` rewrites only the `TypeError` as
  `Could not reach the API (<path>) — is the server running?` and rethrows
  everything else untouched, so React Query's own cancellations are not
  relabelled as network failures. `getProfile`/`getReview` also forward React
  Query's `AbortSignal`, so a superseded request is cancelled rather than
  landing later and being reported as a failure.

`Conflict.resolution` (`str | None`) is the one schema addition: conflicts are
kept after resolution, not deleted — the record of who-said-what and what was
chosen is the point.

---

## 11. Guardrails worth building in from day one

- **Traceability everywhere** — every generated sentence should be attributable to a source document. This isn't optional polish; it's what keeps the tailored CV honest.
- **Human review checkpoint** before final render — don't auto-send a generated CV without the person seeing it. *(Phase 4: enforced by the graph itself — `human_review` interrupts before rendering whenever a flagged run would produce a document, and unapproved claims are removed rather than shipped.)*
- **Conflict surfacing, not silent resolution** — if LinkedIn says one date and the CV says another, ask, don't guess.
- **No keyword-stuffing beyond what's true** — mirroring job-post terminology is fine; claiming unlisted skills is not.

---

## 12. Suggested build order

1. CareerProfile schema + docx/PDF/GitHub extraction (no LinkedIn yet — get the pipeline working on CV+GitHub first).
2. Synthesis agent + storage.
3. Job Analysis + Tailoring agent (the actual value-add).
4. Validation agent (do this before shipping to real use, not after).
5. LinkedIn export ingestion.
6. Document rendering + review UI.

## 13. Implementation notes — Phase 1 (2026-07-18)

Phase 1 implements §12 steps 1–4 as two **separate LangGraph `StateGraph`s**
sharing one schema module (`src/models/schemas.py`), since ingestion and
tailoring run at different times. State is a `TypedDict` per graph; node names
are verbs. There is no orchestrator graph yet — FastAPI routes invoke each
graph directly.

### Ingestion graph (`src/agents/ingestion_graph.py`)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    START --> ingest_sources --> extract_source --> synthesize_profile --> store_profile --> END
```

- `ingest_sources` — validates non-empty sources (deterministic).
- `extract_source` — one Haiku call per `SourceDocument` (a GitHub source is
  batched per repo instead — §3) → `SourceExtraction`; the `source` field of
  every extracted experience/project is **overwritten in code** with the
  document id, so traceability never depends on the model. Partial failures are
  salvaged item-by-item and a dead source is skipped rather than failing the run
  — see §4 "Two-tier extraction resilience". Whatever it could not read is
  reported in `source_errors`, and a GitHub document whose repos were dropped
  yields `pruned_sources` for `store_profile` to apply.
- `synthesize_profile` — one Sonnet call merges extractions into a
  `CareerProfile`; dedupe + conflict surfacing happen in the prompt, but
  `raw_source_map` is built **deterministically** from the merged entries'
  `source` fields (`synthesis.build_raw_source_map`).
- `store_profile` — versioned JSON store (no LLM); when the run carries a
  `run_id` it also writes a copy of the profile to
  `data/output/{run_id}/output.json`, applies any `pruned_sources` to the run
  archive (rewriting `github.json`, preserving `github.raw.json`), and links the
  run's manifest to the new `profile_id`/`version` (`src/utils/run_store.py`).

**Run tracking / provenance.** Each `/ingest` execution is assigned a `run_id`
(the same value as `job_id`; generated if the client omits it). Before the graph
runs, `src/api/routes.py` archives every raw input under `data/sources/{run_id}/`
via `run_store.save_source_file` (CV bytes persisted **before** parsing so inputs
survive a later failure; GitHub serialized to `github.json`; the `free_text` /
LinkedIn-summary input to `linkedin-summary.txt`) and writes a `manifest.json`
indexing them (category, filename, size, sha256). This ties raw inputs → produced
output, which neither `job_id` (SSE only) nor `profile_id` (storage key) did
before. A `contextvars`-based `run_id` (`src/utils/logging_setup.py`) tags every
node's log line `[run:<run_id>]` for cross-step tracing, and
`SourceDocument.stored_path` links a source back to its archived file. Phase 2
added the dedicated LinkedIn path: an uploaded data export is archived under the
same `linkedin/` category (as `<original-name>.zip`, alongside the pasted
`linkedin-summary.txt` the `free_text` field still produces) and parsed by
`src/tools/linkedin_export.py`.

### Tailoring graph (`src/agents/tailoring_graph.py`)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    START --> analyze_job --> tailor_cv --> validate_cv --> prepare_review --> human_review
    human_review -.->|"interrupt(): flags + render"| PAUSED[["paused — awaiting a person"]]
    PAUSED -.->|"Command(resume=decision)"| human_review
    human_review -->|want_cover_letter| write_cover_letter --> render_document
    human_review -->|otherwise| render_document
    render_document --> END
```

- `analyze_job` — Sonnet → `JobRequirements`.
- `tailor_cv` — Sonnet with hard no-fabrication rules in the system prompt →
  `TailoredCV`.
- `prepare_review` / `human_review` (Phase 4) — the human-in-the-loop
  checkpoint; see the section below. Both are no-ops unless the run would
  otherwise render flagged claims.
- `write_cover_letter` (Phase 3) — Sonnet → `CoverLetter`; reached only via the
  conditional edge, i.e. when the caller asked for one, so the default path
  costs no extra LLM call. Phase 4 moved this edge *after* `human_review`, so
  the letter can only draw on claims that survived the review.
- `render_document` (Phase 3) — no LLM; renders `.docx`/PDF into
  `data/documents/{tailor_id}/`. Renders nothing when the caller did not ask
  (`render`) or when the gate blocks it, reporting why in `render_skipped`.
- `validate_cv` — layered gate: (a) exact `raw_source_map` hit passes;
  (b) difflib similarity vs. original bullets ≥ threshold
  (`VALIDATION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`, default 0.55) passes; (c) anything
  below threshold goes to an LLM cross-check; unsupported claims are
  returned as `needs_review` flags. Skill/experience/project membership
  checks are fully deterministic. Phase 3 gave the flags teeth (they block
  `render_document`, §9); Phase 4 turned that block into a pause a person
  answers.

State carries `tailor_id` (one `/tailor` execution, the key of the document
store *and* the checkpointer thread id), the caller's `render` /
`want_cover_letter` / `approved` flags, the results `cover_letter`,
`documents`, `render_skipped`, and the Phase 4 `review_request` /
`review_decision`.

### Human-in-the-loop review (Phase 4, 2026-07-21)

Phases 1–3 reviewed flags **client-side**: `/tailor` returned
`validation.flags`, and a caller who still wanted a document re-ran the whole
graph with `approve_flagged=true`. Two things were wrong with that. It is a
convention, not a guarantee — a client that ignores the flags renders anyway.
And re-running re-tailors: the CV that renders is a *different draft* from the
one that was reviewed, at the cost of a second set of LLM calls.

`prepare_review` + `human_review` close both holes with LangGraph's
`interrupt()`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Reviewer (UI or curl)
    participant API as FastAPI
    participant G as Tailoring graph
    participant CP as MemorySaver
    U->>API: POST /tailor {render: true}
    API->>G: invoke(state, thread_id=tailor_id)
    G->>G: analyze_job → tailor_cv → validate_cv
    G->>G: prepare_review — flags found, brief written
    G->>G: human_review — interrupt()
    G->>CP: checkpoint state
    G-->>API: __interrupt__ [ReviewRequest]
    API-->>U: 200 {review_required: true, review: {...}}
    Note over U: decides per item
    U->>API: POST /tailor/{id}/resume {approvals}
    API->>G: invoke(Command(resume=decision), thread_id=tailor_id)
    CP-->>G: restore the exact reviewed state
    G->>G: apply_decision → prune → render_document
    G-->>API: documents
    API-->>U: 200 {documents: [...]}
```

- **When it pauses.** Only when all three hold: `render` was requested,
  `validation.needs_review` is true, and the caller did not pre-approve. A run
  that renders nothing has nothing to gate, and `approve_flagged=true` keeps
  the Phase 3 path working unchanged.
- **What the person sees** (`ReviewRequest`) — one `ReviewItem` per flag with a
  stable `id`, the flagged text, why the gate could not place it, and the
  *closest sourced claim in the profile* with its source id, so the judgement
  can be made without re-reading the profile. Plus an optional `brief` from the
  review agent (below).
- **What their answer does** (`ReviewDecision` → `review.apply_decision`) —
  approved claims stay and remain in `validation.flags` for provenance (a human
  accepting a claim is not the gate having traced it); everything else is
  **removed** from the CV. Removal covers the structured fields *and* the
  `summary`/`headline` prose that may restate the claim: whole sentences naming
  a rejected term are dropped, and a headline naming one falls back to the
  profile's headline. Without that, rejecting a skill only moved it from the
  skills line into the pitch above it — found in a live run, not in review.
- **Silence is removal.** An item omitted from `approvals` is not approved. The
  default answer to "we could not trace this" must be to drop it.
- **Why it is two nodes.** LangGraph re-runs an interrupted node **from the
  top** when it resumes — `interrupt()` returns the answer the second time
  through rather than pausing again. Everything with a cost or a side effect
  therefore lives in `prepare_review` (a node that has already *completed* when
  the pause happens): building the request, the review agent's LLM call, and
  the write to `review.json`. `human_review` holds nothing but the `interrupt()`
  and the decision handling, so resuming is free. Producing a `review_request`
  is also the signal to pause: `human_review` is a no-op without one.
- **Where the pause lives.** A module-level `MemorySaver` shared by every
  compiled graph, keyed by `thread_id = tailor_id`, because the pause has to
  outlive the request that created it. It is in-process: **a restart loses
  pending resumes** (`409`). The `ReviewRequest` itself is written to
  `data/documents/{tailor_id}/review.json` before pausing, so the record of
  what a person was asked survives regardless; only the ability to continue
  that run does not. A durable checkpointer is the upgrade path.

**Known gap:** the validation gate inspects bullets, skills, experiences and
projects — never the tailored `summary`/`headline` prose. Review scrubbing
catches literal restatements of a *rejected* claim, but a summary that
paraphrases an unsupported claim is checked by nothing at all.

### The review agent (`src/agents/review.py`, Phase 4)

The one place `fund_models/agent_base.py` earns its keep, deferred here from
Phase 1.b. Every other LLM node is a single-shot `with_structured_output` call
whose skill is known in advance, so it resolves that skill deterministically
(§"Agent skills"). Writing the reviewer's brief is the first genuinely
*agentic* step — the model decides what guidance it needs — so `ReviewAgent`
subclasses `AgentBase`: `_load_skills` loads the same `skills/` directory,
`get_skills_context()` puts the catalog in the system prompt, and
`register_tool` receives FUND's runtime `load_skill_from_fs` tool, which the
agent calls mid-loop to pull a full skill body (typically `anti-fabrication`,
so its explanation matches the standard the items were judged against).

Two deliberate deviations: `get_llm()` is overridden onto this project's
`make_llm` (keeping model tiering, the provider switch and the single
test-mock point — `AgentBase.get_llm` would also send a `temperature` current
Claude models reject), and the tool loop is bounded by
`REVIEW_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`. The brief is **advisory**: disabled agent, failed
call or exhausted budget all yield `""`, because the flagged items are what
gate rendering and a missing explanation must never block a human review.
`skills/cv-review/SKILL.md` holds the briefing reasoning — notably the rule
against proposing wording that would get a claim past the gate.

### From job description to targeted CV: one request, step by step

§6–§9 describe each stage in isolation. This is the whole path a single job
description takes, from the HTTP request to a downloadable file — the order
things happen in, what each step reads and writes, and where a run can stop.

| # | Step | Where | Model / skill | In → out |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Accept the request | `src/api/routes.py:tailor` | — | `TailorRequest` → loaded `CareerProfile` + a fresh `tailor_id`. Unknown profile/version → **404**; blank `job_post` → **400**. The graph then runs in a worker thread (`anyio.to_thread.run_sync`) so the event loop stays free |
| 1 | `analyze_job` | `src/agents/job_analysis.py` | `TAILORING_MODEL` + `job-analysis` | Raw JD text (fenced by `--- JOB POST START/END ---`) → `JobRequirements`. The posting is never regex-parsed; the model splits must-haves from nice-to-haves and lifts ATS phrasing |
| 2 | `tailor_cv` | `src/agents/tailoring.py` | `TAILORING_MODEL` + `cv-tailoring` **+** `anti-fabrication` | Full profile JSON + requirements JSON → `TailoredCV`. Selects a *subset* of experiences/projects, re-orders bullets, mirrors the posting's terminology only where a profile fact supports it |
| 3 | `validate_cv` | `src/agents/validation.py` | `VALIDATION_MODEL` + `anti-fabrication`, **only** for step 3c | Profile + tailored CV → `ValidationResult`. Three layers, cheapest first (below) |
| 4 | `prepare_review` → `human_review` *(Phase 4)* | `src/agents/tailoring_graph.py` → `src/agents/review.py` | `REVIEW_MODEL` + `cv-review` (brief only, advisory) | `ValidationResult` → a `ReviewRequest`, then `interrupt()` — when flags exist **and** `render` was asked for. The run pauses here; `ReviewDecision` comes back on `/resume`, rejected claims are pruned from the CV, and `approved` is set. Both nodes pass through otherwise. Split in two because a resumed node re-executes from the top, and the brief must not be paid for twice |
| 5 | `write_cover_letter` *(optional)* | `src/agents/tailoring.py` | `COVER_LETTER_MODEL` + `cover-letter` **+** `anti-fabrication` | Profile + requirements + the tailored CV (minus `relevance_notes`) → `CoverLetter`. Reached only via the conditional edge, so the default path never pays for it. Runs *after* review, so it cannot quote a rejected claim |
| 6 | `render_document` | `src/agents/tailoring_graph.py` → `src/agents/document.py` | none (no LLM) | Tailored CV (+ letter) → files in `data/documents/{tailor_id}/`, or `render_skipped` explaining why nothing was written |
| 7 | Respond & persist | `src/api/routes.py:tailor` | — | Final state → JSON response (each document carries a ready-made `url`), and `tailor.json` is written beside the files |
| 8 | Download | `GET /document/{tailor_id}` | — | `kind`/`format` → the file, served from the document store |

**Step 3 in detail — the gate is layered so most claims cost nothing.** For every
bullet in the tailored CV:

1. **exact hit** in `CareerProfile.raw_source_map` → passes, no model call;
2. else **difflib similarity** against every original profile bullet — a ratio
   ≥ `VALIDATION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (0.55) is treated as a rewording and
   passes;
3. else **one LLM cross-check** for that claim alone; "not supported" becomes a
   `ValidationFlag` carrying the similarity score.

Skills, experiences and projects never reach the model at all: they are checked
deterministically for membership in the profile (skill name, `(company, title)`,
project name — all case-insensitive). `needs_review` is simply "any flag at
all".

**Where a run stops.** Only three places, all of them explicit in the response:

- **404/400 at step 0** — nothing ran, nothing was charged.
- **Flags at step 4** (Phase 4) — when `render` was requested the run **pauses**
  and returns `review_required` with the flagged items; nothing is written
  until `/resume` carries a decision. Before Phase 4 it instead completed with
  an empty `documents` and a `render_skipped` reason, and the caller re-ran the
  whole graph with `approve_flagged` — still available, and now the way to skip
  the pause deliberately.
- **`render: false`** (the default) — steps 1–3 run, step 4 passes through
  (nothing can be rendered, so nothing is gated) and step 6 no-ops with
  `render_skipped: "rendering not requested"`. This is the JSON-only path Phases
  1–2 had.

**Cost per request:** two LLM calls minimum (steps 1 and 2), plus one per claim
that falls through to step 3c, plus one for the review brief if the run pauses,
plus one if a cover letter was asked for. The profile is read from storage, so
ingestion never re-runs — the same profile can be tailored to any number of
postings. A paused run that is resumed costs **no** second tailoring call: the
CV that renders is the one that was reviewed.

**Two properties worth noting, because they are easy to assume otherwise:**

- `raw_source_map` is **excluded** from the tailoring prompt
  (`model_dump(exclude={"raw_source_map"})`). It is the validator's evidence
  index, so the generator never sees the map its output will be scored against.
- The **cover letter is not re-validated**. Step 3 runs before step 4 and only
  over the `TailoredCV`; the letter is constrained by its skill and by being
  handed the already-tailored facts, but no deterministic gate re-checks it.
  Rendering it is still blocked by the CV's flags.

### Model tiering (env-configurable, `src/config.py`)

| Stage | Env var | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Extraction | `EXTRACTION_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| Synthesis | `SYNTHESIS_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| Job analysis + tailoring | `TAILORING_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| Cover letter | `COVER_LETTER_MODEL` | `TAILORING_MODEL` (same task, same rules) |
| Validation cross-check | `VALIDATION_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` (override to `claude-opus-4-8` for max precision) |
| Review brief (Phase 4) | `REVIEW_MODEL` | `VALIDATION_MODEL` (it explains that gate's findings) |

Every LLM node uses `make_llm(...).with_structured_output(<PydanticModel>)`
via the single factory `src/agents/llm.py:make_llm` — no free-form JSON
parsing anywhere. The one exception is the Phase 4 review agent, which binds
tools instead of a structured schema (it writes prose, and chooses which skill
to load), but still goes through `make_llm`. The factory follows the same method as FUND's
`AgentBase.get_llm()` (provider switch + lazy imports, configured via
`LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_TEMPERATURE`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`,
`LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_STREAM_TIMEOUT_S`), defaulting to `anthropic`; `model`
and `max_tokens` remain per-call arguments because models are tiered per
pipeline stage. Temperature is only passed when explicitly configured, since
current Claude models reject non-default sampling parameters.

### Agent skills (`SKILL.md`, Phase 1.b, 2026-07-20)

Each agent's hand-tuned reasoning (extraction fact/inference rules, synthesis
dedupe/conflict strategy, job-analysis decomposition, tailoring HARD RULES,
anti-fabrication cross-check) lives in a versioned **skill** under `skills/`
rather than a hardcoded prompt string, reusing FUND's skills mechanism verbatim
(`fund_models/skills.py`, consumed via `scan_skills`). Skills hold *reasoning*
(strategies, heuristics), never actions.

```
skills/
├── source-extraction/SKILL.md   # extraction
├── profile-synthesis/SKILL.md   # synthesis
├── job-analysis/SKILL.md        # job_analysis
├── cv-tailoring/SKILL.md        # tailoring (HARD RULES)
├── anti-fabrication/SKILL.md    # validation (also composed into tailoring + cover letter)
├── cover-letter/SKILL.md        # cover letter (Phase 3): shape + register
└── cv-review/SKILL.md           # review brief (Phase 4): loaded at runtime, by a tool call
```

Each `SKILL.md` is YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) + a Markdown body.
`src/agents/skills.py` is a thin adapter over `fund_models.skills`:
`resolve_skill(name)` returns a body with frontmatter stripped (cached per
`SKILLS_DIR`); `skills_catalog()` returns the frontmatter-only summary
(`AgentBase.get_skills_context` format) for discovery.

Because the Phase 1 nodes are single-shot `with_structured_output` calls (not
tool-calling loops), skills are resolved **deterministically by node**: each
`src/chains/prompts/*_prompt.py` module keeps only structural scaffolding (a
`{skill}` slot + the `USER` template), and the node prepends
`resolve_skill("<node-skill>")` into that slot. The tailoring prompt composes
two skills (`cv-tailoring` + `anti-fabrication`). Resolution degrades
gracefully: a missing/empty `SKILLS_DIR` yields an empty body, so a node falls
back to its scaffolding and still runs — which is why the migration is
behavior-preserving (the skill body is the prior prompt text verbatim).

FUND's runtime `load_skill` tool and `AgentBase` are used by exactly one node,
added in Phase 4: the review agent, which is tool-calling and therefore picks
its own skill instead of being handed one (see "The review agent" above). Every
other node keeps the deterministic resolution described here.

### Storage schema

Versioned JSON files (single-user; no Postgres):

```
data/
├── profiles/{profile_id}/
│   ├── v1.json      # CareerProfile serialized by Pydantic
│   ├── v2.json      # e.g. after a user edit via PUT /profile/{id}
│   └── latest       # plain-text pointer to the current version number
├── sources/{run_id}/            # per-run raw-input archive (src/utils/run_store.py)
│   ├── cv/<original-name>        # raw uploaded CV bytes (saved before parsing)

│   └── manifest.json             # index (category, filename, size, sha256) + profile_id/version
├── output/{run_id}/output.json   # copy of the synthesized profile for the run
└── documents/{tailor_id}/        # rendered documents (Phase 3, src/utils/document_store.py)
    ├── cv.docx / cv.pdf
    ├── cover-letter.docx / cover-letter.pdf
    ├── tailor.json               # the run's tailored CV, validation result, cover letter
    └── review.json               # flagged items a person was shown (Phase 4, if it paused)
```

`profile_store.py` owns `profiles/`; `run_store.py` owns `sources/` and
`output/`; `document_store.py` owns `documents/`. `run_id` = one ingest
execution; `tailor_id` = one `/tailor` execution; `profile_id` = an evolving
profile that may span runs. Document filenames are fixed per (kind, format) and
`tailor_id` is restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, so a `GET /document` request
can never address a path outside its own directory. Raw CVs are **retained** here (previously deleted after
parsing) — see OPERATIONS.md for the retention/privacy note.

### Merge flow (planned — Phase 1.d)

> Design only; not yet implemented. Recorded here so the roadmap and the
> component design stay in one place (see PLAN.md → Phase 1.d).

Ingestion is last-write-wins: `synthesize_profile` only ever sees the current
run's extractions, so re-ingesting into the same `profile_id` (Phase 1.c) never
unions with prior runs. The **merge** flow combines the synthesized snapshots two
or more prior runs already wrote (`data/output/{run_id}/output.json`) into one
new profile version — no CV re-parse, no per-source Haiku re-extraction.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    START --> load_run_outputs --> merge_profiles --> store_profile --> END
```

- `load_run_outputs` — deterministic; a new `run_store.load_output(run_id)`
  (mirroring `save_output`) loads each requested run's `output.json` into a
  `CareerProfile`. Missing snapshot → 404.
- `merge_profiles` — **reuses synthesis**: one `SYNTHESIS_MODEL` call with the
  `profile-synthesis` skill and structured output `CareerProfile`, over a merge
  variant of the synthesis USER prompt that frames the inputs as
  already-synthesized profiles rather than per-source extractions. It dedupes
  entries describing the same job/project across profiles and **surfaces** cross-
  profile disagreements into `conflicts` (unioning each input's existing
  conflicts) — never silently resolving them, exactly as first-pass synthesis
  does. `raw_source_map` is rebuilt deterministically via
  `synthesis.build_raw_source_map`; every entry keeps its original `source`, so
  claim→source traceability is preserved across the merge. A purely deterministic
  list-union is rejected — it would duplicate the same job across sources and drop
  conflict surfacing, the core anti-fabrication guarantee.
- `store_profile` — reused from ingestion. The merge is assigned its own fresh
  `run_id`; the merged profile is stored as a new version of the target
  `profile_id` (`profile_store.save_profile`) and copied to
  `data/output/{run_new}/output.json` (`run_store.save_output`). The merge run's
  `manifest.json` records `merged_from: [run_ids]` (a new optional field on
  `write_manifest`) instead of raw source files, and links to the produced
  `profile_id`/`version`. This keeps `run_id` = one execution (here, one merge)
  and `profile_id` = the evolving profile, consistent with the rest of §13.

Exposed as `POST /merge` (`{run_ids: [...], profile_id?: ...}`) — a dedicated
endpoint rather than an `/ingest` mode, since a merge takes no file upload and its
inputs are prior runs referenced by id.

### API / SSE

FastAPI app factory (`src/api/main.py`) + routes (`src/api/routes.py`).
Long-running ingestion progress is streamed per-node over SSE using an
in-process job registry (`dict[job_id, asyncio.Queue]`); the graph runs in a
worker thread and publishes node names via `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`. The
client may supply its own `job_id` form field so it can subscribe before
POSTing. `POST /tailor` is synchronous (no SSE) and, since Phase 3, returns a
`tailor_id` whose rendered files are downloaded from
`GET /document/{tailor_id}?kind=&format=` — served with `FileResponse` from the
document store, 404 when that file was not rendered. Since Phase 4 it may also
return *paused*, with `GET /tailor/{tailor_id}/review` and
`POST /tailor/{tailor_id}/resume` continuing that run (`409` when nothing is
pending). Everything ships in **one Docker container** — now multi-stage:
a `node:20-slim` stage builds the review UI, and the python:3.11-slim runtime
(+ `libreoffice-writer` for PDF) serves both it and the API from uvicorn on
0.0.0.0:8000, with `data/` volume-mounted.
